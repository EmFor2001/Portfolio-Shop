# Hello to my first big react project
This site was made purely for training and is not real business site. In here I wanted to focus and learning mainly the basics of react. The site may not look great and may not be ideally responsive, but have some small features and tricks that use react-router, JSON-server and Context API to work fine and be as easy as possible. <br/>
For now it only fetches products data from JSON-server and uses context API across the whole application to update the cart counter on the navbar. The cart page alone is still WIP but could be working in future. <br/>
